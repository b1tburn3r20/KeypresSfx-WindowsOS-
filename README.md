Hey and thanks for installing KeypresSfx

To get your keypress sfx all you have to do is:

- Open the folder Keypress
- Double click the KeypresSfx .exe
- Wait for your terminal to boot it up

And you're set. once you see the "Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html" You are good to go and the keypresses should sound away!

Happy Coding!
